<h3>Tipperary</h3>

  <mat-tab label="Overview">
      <p>In the 1860s, County Tipperary contained some of the best organised Fenian circles.  The IRB contained a substantial number of men and weaponry, and also had sympathisers within the British military.</p>
      <p>In September 1865, Stephens wrote to the IRB leadership in Clonmel, instructing the B's to choose a new leader.   The letter informed the local movement that “the best course to take is to get all the working B’s together, and after due deliberation and without favour to any one – acting purely and conscientiously for the good of the cause – to select one man to represent and direct you all...  This year – and let there be no mistake about it – must be the year of action.”  This implicated Stephens in a conspiracy against the government and was passed onto Dublin Castle by an informer in the offices of the <em>Irish People</em>, Pierce Nagle.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of this, much of the leadership of the IRB, including Stephens (briefly), were imprisoned.</p>

  <mat-tab label="Thomas Talbot">
      <p>Thomas Talbot, a detective from Dublin, was posing under cover as a Fenian in Clonmel, in order to collect intelligence on IRB activities there.  Whilst there, he posed as a water-bailiff called Kelly and ingratiated himself with senior members of the movement in Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel.</p>
      <p>Whilst gathering information in Carrick-on-Suir in 1865, he became acquainted with a number of figures, including Philip Morrissey, William Maher, William Ryan, William Dobbyn and John Daniel.</p>
      <p>Following the raid on the offices of the <em>Irish People</em>, Talbot returned to Tipperary to collect more intelligence.</p>

  <mat-tab label="Military Sympathisers">
      <p>During this time, a significant number of British soldiers in Tipperary were ready to abandon their posts and throw their support behind the rebels.  They were prepared to provide the army's weaponry to the IRB when a rising was called.  Present at some of the Fenian meetings which Talbot attended were Colour-Sergeant Charles McCarthy and Private James Keilly of the 53rd Regiment of Foot.  These were preparing to hand over a large amount of arms to the IRB in the event of a rebellion.</p>
      <p>Another British soldier who attended some of the meetings was a Bombardier Lowe of the Royal Artillary, who according to Talbot, informed him that he had forty-four sworn-in Fenians in the Artillary in Clonmel.</p>

  <mat-tab label="Timothy Maxey">
      <p>Timothy Maxey, was a cooper from Clonmel and the son of a well-known publican on Johnson Street in that town, William Maxey.  He was sworn into the IRB in 1862-63, according to testimony from the police informer, Pierce Nagle.  Maxey was one of those to whom Stephens' September 1865 letter, directing the Clonmel B's to choose a new centre, was directed.  By the end of 1865, he would be the Clonmel centre.</p>
      <p>Maxey was one of the Fenian leaders who attended meetings with Talbot, whilst disguised as the water-bailiff, Kelly.  On 31 January 1866, Talbot travelled to Clonmel to meet with Maxey at Tom Burke's public house.  Talbot asked about a Private Burke of the 73rd Regiment, who was allegedly co-operating with Maxey and had assisted him in the swearing in of soldiers in Clonmel.
      Maxey offered to introduce Talbot to Burke and duly did so later on that day.  Burke expressed the view to Talbot taht the Curragh should be attacked first, as he claimed that nearly all of the soldiers there were Fenians.</p>
      <p>During the following day, 1 February, Maxey came to visit Talbot at this lodgings in Clonmel.  Talbot asked Maxey if he was in possession of false keys for the arms and ammunition stores at the barracks.  Maxey replied that he was, that one of them was stiff and that he had arranged with a soldier to test it when next on guard at the barracks.  Later during the evening, Maxey, Talbot and Burke met again at Thomas Burke's public house, and Maxey told Talbot that there were about forty-four Fenian soldiers in the Artillery.  Burke added that there were four or five within the 73rd Regiment.</p>
      <p>On the next day, 2 February, a policeman arrived in Clonmel from Carrick-on-Suir with a warrant for the arrest of Maxey, on the charge of being connected with the Fenian conspiracy.  Sub-Constable Pilkington took Maxey into custody at his house on William Street.  Subsequently, on 5 February, McCarthy was arrested on a charge of Fenianism.   Also arrested were Brennan, Keilly, William Maher, John Maher, Morrissey, Daniel, Dobbyn, Hoare and John Brien.</p>
